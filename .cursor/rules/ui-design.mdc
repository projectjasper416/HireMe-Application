# Cursor Project Rules for UI & Code Generation

## 🎨 Design & UX Guidelines
- All UIs should look clean, modern, and professional — inspired by Apple, Linear, and Vercel.
- Prioritize smooth user experience with clear information hierarchy and intuitive interactions.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- Use **Framer Motion** for animations and transitions.
- Use grid or flex layouts for consistent alignment.
- Use large rounded corners (`rounded-2xl` or `rounded-lg`), soft shadows, and subtle transitions.
- Typography:
  - Headings: bold, large (e.g., `text-4xl font-bold`)
  - Subheadings: medium weight (`text-xl font-medium`)
  - Body text: `text-base text-gray-600`
- Keep color palettes neutral by default, with soft accent tones.

## 🧰 Frontend Stack Rules
- Use **React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion** (or Next.js if already in use).
- Components must be **modular**, reusable, and well-commented.
- Keep code readable, avoid nesting too deeply.
- Prefer functional components with clear props.
- Ensure full **responsiveness** across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## 🛠 Code Quality & Style
- Use clear Tailwind class names instead of inline styles.
- Avoid magic numbers; use spacing tokens like `p-4`, `m-6`, etc.
- Use descriptive variable and component names (e.g., `HeroSection`, `FeatureCard`).
- Comment complex parts of code.
- Keep logic and presentation separated.

## ⚙️ Behavior
- Add gentle hover states, transitions (`transition-all duration-300`).
- Use `framer-motion` animations for mounting, scrolling, and interactions.
- Ensure keyboard and accessibility support (`aria-label`, focus states).

## 🧩 Customizability
- Write code that can be easily modified manually later.
- No hard-coded values unless intentional.
- Keep layout and style clear so changes can be done quickly in the future.

## 💬 Example Prompt Integration
When the user requests UI components (e.g., “Build me a landing page for Jasper Labs”), automatically:
1. Use React functional components.
2. Use Tailwind for layout and design.
3. Use Framer Motion for interactivity.
4. Follow all above design and UX principles.
5. Output complete, ready-to-run code.
